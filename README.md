# My own utility functions
I know there are plenty of repos collecting utility functions but this is my way to dig deeper into the JavaScript world.
Each function I'll create will be inside of a folder with an `index.js` file (extension could change) and a `README.md` file. The first will contain the function and the second one will describe the standard behavior and will show some code examples.
